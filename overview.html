<h1>Vital Patient Data Insights with SQL</h1>
<p>This project is a SQL-based hospital management system designed to manage and analyze patient, doctor, and appointment data efficiently. 
It demonstrates essential SQL skills like table creation, foreign key relationships, and advanced queries for data analysis.</p>

<h2>Project Overview:</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Patients Table:</strong> Stores patient details like first name, last name, and gender.</li>
    <li><strong>Doctors Table:</strong> Contains doctor information, including their specialties.</li>
    <li><strong>Appointments Table:</strong> Tracks appointments, linking patients and doctors with appointment dates and statuses.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Key SQL Concepts Demonstrated:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Creating and managing relational database tables.</li>
    <li>Using foreign keys to establish relationships between tables.</li>
    <li>Executing complex queries to retrieve, group, and analyze data.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Sample Queries:</h2>
<pre>
-- Get all scheduled appointments
SELECT * FROM Appointments WHERE status = 'Scheduled';

-- Count patients by gender
SELECT gender, COUNT(*) AS patient_count FROM Patients GROUP BY gender;

-- Join Patients and Appointments to see appointment details
SELECT P.first_name, P.last_name, A.appointment_date, A.status
FROM Patients P
LEFT JOIN Appointments A ON P.patient_id = A.patient_id;
</pre>

<p>This project showcases the power of SQL in managing real-world healthcare data and provides a strong foundation for database management and data insights.</p>
